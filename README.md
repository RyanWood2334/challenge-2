# challenge-2
## Description
This is my personal portfolio, it is (nearly 100%) a responsive webpages, with multiple media queries, a flex grid, multiple flexboxes, and transitions and animations abound. It was really engaging to tackle all these design issues, and while it took a considerable amount of time, learning the ins and outs of these various nuances wasvery valuable to me. I'm excited to keep building on this page and add javaScript to it and really round it all out! Bonus points if you can find the llama!
