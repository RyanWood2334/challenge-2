# challenge-2
## Description
This is a website that discusses search engine optimization, online reputation, and media marketing. Using a mixture of HTML and CSS, with the selectors and specificity that make it more accessible across various platforms. It was challenging to figure out just -how- much you can (and can't) keep boiling down and condensing both the HTML and CSS files. In future projects I think I would try and start refactoring as I go, instead of diving in after 100+ lines of code, in an attempt to be more efficient from the start.
